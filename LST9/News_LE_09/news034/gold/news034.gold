Longtime NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson has been released by the Miami Dolphins after his arrest over the weekend. 
A Davie police officer soon responded to the area and found Johnson's wife with an approximately 3-inch cut on the center of her forehead. 
Johnson confirmed there had been an argument over the sales receipt, saying his wife had been yelling and that "she then head butted Johnson" to cause the cut to her forehead. 
Johnson and Evelyn Lozada, a cast member on the VH1 reality TV show "Basketball Wives", married on July 4 and their time together is set to be subject of an upcoming show on the same network.
