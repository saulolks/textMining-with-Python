"i never saw john akii-bua run, but there are a lot of memories of him", kiprotich told reporters after claiming a surprise victory in the men's marathon on the final day of london 2012.
but until kiprotich's success on sunday, its only other podiums were another runnerup placing in the ring for john mugabi at moscow '80 and bronze for 400m runner davis kamoga at atlanta '96.
coached by benjamin longiross, who placed 62nd for uganda in the marathon at seoul '88, kiprotich denied kenya -- a country where he has trained in recent years -- a second successive men's title.
kiprotich made his move after 38 of the 42 kilometers, bursting clear before taking a ugandan flag from the crowd as he crossed the finish line in a time of two hours, eight minutes and one second.
