Britain has brought the Olympics back to what they have been and should always be. And we did it with that unique common sense for which my country is known. 
In London an original, fictional bid-budget of £2.7 billion ($4.2 billion) was quickly abandoned in 2007 in favor of a realistic, £9.3 billion ($14.6 billion) with a huge contingency for unforeseen costs such as security. 
So when the IOC President Jacques Rogge said, "London has created a legacy blueprint" and "has raised the bar on how to deliver a lasting legacy", we can neatly tick that one off as a rousing success from which other cities can learn. 
For the British people themselves, there has been a renewed pride in the country -- helped of course by record gold medals.
