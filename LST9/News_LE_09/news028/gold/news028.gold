Rory McIlroy stormed to his second major title on Sunday as he won the PGA Championship by eight shots at Kiawah Island in South Carolina and returned to the top of the world golf rankings. 
The Northern Irishman played 27 holes after coming back to the Ocean Course early to complete his third round, after which he had built a three-shot lead. 
His closest challenger was unheralded Englishman David Lynn, playing only his second major tournament nine years since his first at the British Open. 
Woods must continue his four-year wait for a 15th major title after finishing tied for 11th, closing with 74 and 72.
