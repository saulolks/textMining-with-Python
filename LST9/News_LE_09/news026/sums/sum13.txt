although the games closed sunday with the olympic flag being handed over to the 2016 host city of rio de janeiro, enthusiasm for the london olympics appears to be as strong as during the last two weeks when competitors performed in front of packed stadia and to a global audience of millions.
it remains to be seen whether these bids are completed, but another enthusiast has offered double the basketball price for a limited edition of a 2012 olympic torch signed by bradley wiggins -- the british cyclist who added the time trial gold medal to his victory in this year's tour de france.
another bidder says they are prepared to pay £3,000 ($4,709) for a two-meter high sculpture of wenlock -- one of the 2012 mascots -- and £456 ($716) is the current price for a set of goal posts used in the handball final.
organizers say building the venues, improving infrastructure and staging the event cost in excess of £9 billion ($14 billion) with the cash coming from both public funds and through sponsorship, ticket sales, merchandizing and the sale of media rights.
