With only a few hours left in one sale, more than £3,000 ($4,709) has been bid for the basketball used in the men's final won by the USA in a close-fought game with Spain. 
The London Olympics organizing committee, LOCOG, says the money raised so far has helped subsidize the costs of torches and torchbearers and also contributes towards hosting the giant sporting festival. 
"We've had 1,735 different items put up for sale, and the biggest seller has been the torches". 
Flags, balls, boxing headgear, athletes' signed photos -- even a farmer's sickle from the pastoral scene at the opening -- are still up for grabs.
