There were so many golden moments at the London 2012 Games, but for me, the moment that Team GB's Mo Farah won the 10,000 meters was a wonderful collision of electricity. 
The thing about Mo -- apart from his endless speed, dedication, humility and talent -- is that he came to Britain as a refugee from Somalia, one of the world's most war-torn countries. 
I think the London 2012 Games will come to be seen as a shining time for the UK. 
I've been lucky enough to have had a similar view of the United Kingdom as the Olympic flame did as it traveled my country, because in 2009, I ran 43 marathons -- 1166 miles -- around the British Isles, and I saw first hand, how positive and supportive the real British people can be.
