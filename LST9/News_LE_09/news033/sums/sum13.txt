guor marial made his debut in the london games on sunday, a major accomplishment for the south sudanese marathoner who ran as an independent in the olympics.
marial, 28, pounded his way around the 26.2-mile course in 2:19:32. he finished 47th in the race dominated by fellow africans steven kiprotich of uganda, who won gold, and abel kirui and wilson kiprotich, both of kenya, who won silver and bronze, respectively.
though he is a permanent resident of the united states, where he fled 11 years ago to escape the bloody conflict, he is not an american citizen and thus cannot compete under its flag.
marial left home in 1993. 
his story of survival from the war has taken him across different countries, including egypt, where he sought refuge before the united states granted him asylum in 2001. 
he attended high school in new hampshire, where he gave competitive running a try after years of "running away from conflict", he said.
