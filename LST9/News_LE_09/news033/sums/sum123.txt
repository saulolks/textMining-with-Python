the marathoner was born in what is now south sudan, which split from sudan last year after years of conflict between the two that left millions dead.
though he is a permanent resident of the united states, where he fled 11 years ago to escape the bloody conflict, he is not an american citizen and thus cannot compete under its flag.
marial left home in 1993. 
his story of survival from the war has taken him across different countries, including egypt, where he sought refuge before the united states granted him asylum in 2001. 
he attended high school in new hampshire, where he gave competitive running a try after years of "running away from conflict", he said.
