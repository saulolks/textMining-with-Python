"Even if I am not going to carry or wear the flag, I will be the flag of my nation. South Sudan will be in my heart", he said before the race. 
Guor Marial made his debut in the London Games on Sunday, a major accomplishment for the South Sudanese marathoner who ran as an independent in the Olympics. 
The marathoner was born in what is now South Sudan, which split from Sudan last year after years of conflict between the two that left millions dead. 
He does not have a passport for South Sudan, either, and cannot compete for his homeland.
