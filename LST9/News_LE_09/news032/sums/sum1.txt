nbc was pummeled by viewers who took to social media after the network cut away early from the closing ceremony of the london games on sunday to air a new television show, drawing outrage from those who tuned in for the highly anticipated musical spectacle.
earlier in the games, nbc came under fire for filing a complaint over tweets by guy adams, the los angeles-based journalist whose twitter account was temporarily suspended after he criticized nbc for its olympics coverage.
the network also came under fire for spoiling the results of usa swimmer missy franklin's gold medal-winning race when it ran a "today" show promo that revealed the outcome of the race before it was telecast that night.
nbc commentator bob costas appeared to acknowledge the issue with the network's tape-delayed coverage, saying during the broadcast that some of the challenges at the london games would be eliminated at the rio games in 2016 because they will be held in a time zone only one hour ahead of eastern time.
