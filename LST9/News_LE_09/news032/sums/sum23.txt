nbc was pummeled by viewers who took to social media after the network cut away early from the closing ceremony of the london games on sunday to air a new television show, drawing outrage from those who tuned in for the highly anticipated musical spectacle.
the network was under fire for much of the 16 days of the games by viewers who took to twitter and facebook to complain about its tape-delayed coverage of big-ticket events, which nbc has said was necessary to maximize its prime-time audience.
the network also came under fire for spoiling the results of usa swimmer missy franklin's gold medal-winning race when it ran a "today" show promo that revealed the outcome of the race before it was telecast that night.
nbc commentator bob costas appeared to acknowledge the issue with the network's tape-delayed coverage, saying during the broadcast that some of the challenges at the london games would be eliminated at the rio games in 2016 because they will be held in a time zone only one hour ahead of eastern time.
