Nadzeya Ostapchuk won the shot put on August 6, a day after giving a urine sample. 
Both tested positive for the steroid metenolone, the IOC said in a statement. 
Ostapchuk, 31, had finished third at the Beijing Games in 2008 and second at last year's world championships. 
Ostapchuk might face further sanctions from the International Association of Athletics Federations, the governing body of track and field.
